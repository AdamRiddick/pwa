# The Learning Project

## Description

The overall concept is simple - create a solution that allows the technologies and techniques learned through continuous learning to be applied and tested in a real world example.

## Installation

* Clone
* Setup local settings: [See The Wiki](https://github.com/AdamRiddick/pwa/wiki/The-Development-Experience)
* Execute `.\build.ps1` in Powershell
* Run `dotnet run` from the `proxy` folder

## Usage

The application is a basic Todo app.

## Contributing

This is a learning project for me, so I'm unlikely to accept PRs but am completely open to feedback. Feel free to fork and use this as a basis for your own learning.
